-----Js Execution Context
1. this variable will get Global EC
IN ANY BROWSER JS EC VALUE IS WINDOWS
2.js is single threaded 

-----types of EC
1. Global 
2. Functional
3. Eval


-----how js code executes    
1. Memory creation phase -> only space is allocated to variables and stuff
2. Execution phase -> where code runs


-----Example code 

let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 20;
function addNum(num1, num2){
    let total = num1 + num2;
    return total;
}

let result1 = addNum(num1, num2);
let result2 = addNum(10, 5);


                            1. this -> Global EC
                            2. Memory Phase ~ Everything is undefined 
                            3. Execution Phase -> for func, 2 and 3 step will be repeated(for addNum)[new variable environment + Execution thread] 
                            NOTE-> after completion new var and thread gets flushed out
                            4. total will be returned to Global EC
